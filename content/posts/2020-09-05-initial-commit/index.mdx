## Initial Commit

Looking at my old profiles, it has been almost 17 years since [I wrote a blog post](https://www.codeproject.com/Members/nashcontrol). 
I have been playing around with some really good tools lately, and really wanted to share my experiences with the information security community.

Another reason is that I really need a place to document the experiments I have been conducting with some of the bug-bounty and reconnaissance tools released every week.
It is very hard to keep track of all the good things everyone is building. Re-tweeting and taking screenshots on my mobile phone would just no get me where I want to be.

Making this post online did take me about three years (5 years?) of testing various blogging systems, including [Medium](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/goodbye-medium), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and github pages. 
I have been preaching my team mates, [Bill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-ben-haim-b6775a48/) and [Sagi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagi-cohen-437b709a) to actually start doing it, and was excited to see [Roei](https://betheadversary.com/) successfully naling it. I am a strong beliver in leadership by example. Sometimes leaders need to learn from other leaders to try to be as good as they are.
